## Express
ExpressJS is a lightweight framework for building web servers. ExpressJS extends the NodeJS `http` module with a minimal feature set that enables developers to build quickly build powerful web applications. Express features include routing with url params, error handling, a static server, cookie and link helpers, convenience methods for sending json and jsonp, location and redirect management, request parsing, server side rendering, and a framework for creating middleware to extend express.
